Client is failing in postsnaps due to timeout while executing one command.So nothing much can be done on these clients so powered off/on all of them.Verified the reachability by checking ping/uptime/staf running.

Rpowered and rerunning 

Staf  issue.  rpowered the host and verified the staf service. Hence we move this ticket to close pending state.
